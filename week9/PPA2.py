'''You're given a list of tuples Activity for n activities, where in each tuple (activity_name, S, F, P), 
activity activity_name is scheduled to be done from start time s to finish time F and obtains 
a profit of P after the finish.
Find out the maximum profit you can obtained by scheduled activities, but no two activities should
be in the subset with overlapping of time frame. If you choose an activity that finishes at time x 
then another activity can be started at time x, not before that.
Write a function MaxProfit (Activity) that accepts a list of tuples Activity for n activities and 
returns the value of maximum profit that can be obtained by scheduled activities.
Sample Input
[('A',1,2,40), ('B',3,4,5), ('c',0,7,6), ('D',1,2,3), ('E',5,6,8), ('F',5,9,2), 
('G',10,11,9), ('Ð½', 0, 11, 35)]
Output
62
Explanation
Activity schedule [A, B, E, G] gives a profit of 62 which is the maximum in all possible schedules'''
