'''A manufacturing plant has n independent working lines. Each job requires different 
amount of time to be completed and due time. Optimize the scheduling of jobs for every line 
so that every job is will be completed within due time or minimum lateness possible.
Write a function minimizeLateness (N, jobs) to return the sequence of job ids to be scheduled 
in list of list. jobs is the tuple of (job_id, time_required, due_time), where job_id, 
time_required and due_time are the unique number assigned to job, relative time required to 
complete the job and absolute time before which the job should have completed respectively.
Note:
job_id is given from 0 to m-1, for m jobs.
Lateness = m Î£L(i) id=0 -Time Due(i) L(i) = {if (if Time Delivered(i) > 1 TimeDue(i), 
Time Delivered(i) - Time Due(i)) else, 0 (2)}
For each test case there will be a upper bound of lateness on the second line of input. 
The lateness of your optimum schedule should be less than or equal to the upper bound of lateness.'''

    The algorithm uses a greedy approach:
    1. It sorts the jobs in ascending order of their due times (Earliest Due Date rule).
    2. It uses a min-heap to keep track of the completion time of each line, allowing
       for efficient selection of the line that will become available the soonest.
    3. It iterates through the sorted jobs and assigns each job to the line
       with the minimum current completion time.

        N (int): The number of independent working lines.
        jobs (list of tuple): A list of jobs, where each tuple is
